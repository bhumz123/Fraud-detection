# Fraud-detection


## Data Preprocessing:
1. Start by loading the dataset into memory.
2. Explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights.
3. Handle missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies.
4. Perform feature scaling or normalization if required.
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Train the LSTM model:
1. Set up the LSTM architecture, including the number of layers, hidden units, and activation functions.
2. Prepare the training data by formatting it into appropriate input-output sequences.
3. Initialize the LSTM model with the defined architecture.
4. Train the LSTM model using the training data.
5. Monitor the training process and adjust hyperparameters if needed.
6. Save the trained LSTM model for future use.

## Generate LSTM predictions:
1. Load the saved LSTM model.
2. Prepare the testing data by formatting it into appropriate input sequences.
3. Generate predictions using the trained LSTM model.
4. Evaluate the performance of the LSTM predictions using appropriate metrics.

## Combine LSTM predictions with original features:
1. Retrieve the original features from the testing data.
2. Concatenate the LSTM predictions with the original features.
3. Perform any necessary post-processing on the combined data.

## Train the ARF model:
1. Set up the ARF (AutoRegressive Forest) model architecture.
2. Prepare the training data by formatting it into appropriate input-output sequences.
3. Initialize the ARF model with the defined architecture.
4. Train the ARF model using the training data.
5. Save the trained ARF model for future use.

## Generating LSTM predictions for new Data:
1. Load the saved LSTM model.
2. Prepare the new data by formatting it into appropriate input sequences.
3. Generate predictions for the new data using the trained LSTM model.

## Combine LSTM predictions with original features for new data:
1. Retrieve the original features from the new data.
2. Concatenate the LSTM predictions with the original features for the new data.
3. Perform any necessary post-processing on the combined data.

## Make predictions using ensemble:
1. Combine the LSTM predictions with the original features for both the testing data and the new data.
2. Feed the combined data into the trained ARF model.
3. Generate final predictions using the ensemble of LSTM and ARF models.
4. Evaluate the performance of the ensemble predictions using appropriate metrics.
